          The digital landscape is rapidly changing, and so is our relationship with social media.
          What was once a mere act of self-expression, content creation has now evolved into a money-making endeavour thanks to the growing popularity of user-generated content (UGC).
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          From social-media platforms like Instagram and TikTok to blogs, UGC has become ubiquitous, profoundly impacting industries, businesses, and individuals alike.
          But what exactly is UGC?
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          To put simply, UGC includes any form of content made by consumers about a product, service or business.
          So, for example, a video you post of your new shoes on Instagram is a form of UGC.
          Other forms include testimonials, comments, photos and blog posts.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          We’re certain you’ve produced UGC without even realising it!
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          But it doesn’t end there.
          As mentioned above, UGC has emerged as a form of business.
          So, if we dive deeper, we’ll find that there are two types of UGC: organic UGC and paid UGC.

        <rp.h2>Organic UGC</rp.h2>
        <rp.p>
          These are content created voluntarily by the consumers, simply because they feel inspired to share a good word about the business with their followers.
        </rp.p>

        <rp.h2>Paid UGC</rp.h2>
        <rp.p>
          As the name suggests, paid UGC is where a person is paid to create content for a business.
          A popular example are brand deals where businesses pay content creators to make videos about their products or services.
          However, just the fact that someone is paid to talk about a product does not make their content any less credible or genuine.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          If anything, people are more likely to buy a product if it has been recommended by someone they know and trust.
          Indeed, INSG has reported that{" "}
          <rp.a href="https://www.insg.co/en/influencer-marketing-malaysia/">
            34% of Malaysian online shoppers consider suggestions from influencers and content creators before buying a product
          </rp.a>.
          So, it can be quite an effective marketing strategy to convert views into sales.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          It comes as no surprise, then, that more and more businesses in Southeast Asia are investing in UGCs.
          It is certainly not surprising that{" "}
          <rp.a href="/creators/contact">
            many Internet users are leveraging their content-creation skills to become UGC creators too
          </rp.a>.
        </rp.p>
