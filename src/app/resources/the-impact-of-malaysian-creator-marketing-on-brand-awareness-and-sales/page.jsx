          As social media continues to transform every day itself into an information-sharing and learning platform, the role of creator marketing has become increasingly important in spreading brand awareness to larger networks of consumers.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          Research into the factors affecting brand awareness through social media in Malaysia found a positive correlation between customer engagement, brand exposure, and electronic word-of-mouth.

          Moreover, studies show that businesses in Malaysia aren’t fully utilising social media in their marketing campaigns.

          By tapping into the power of Malaysian creator marketing, businesses have the opportunity to leverage the influence and reach of popular social-media figures to amplify their brand awareness.
