          Consumer behaviours are changing.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          More and more people are turning to content creators when deciding whether to make a purchase.
          According to{" "}

          80% of social media users in Asia are more likely to buy a product if it is recommended by a content creator or influencer.

          It comes as no surprise that businesses are eager to leverage the relatability and reach of content creators to boost their marketing needs.
          However, while working with content creators has its advantages, it also presents unique challenges that businesses must navigate to ensure successful collaborations.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          Some of those challenges include communication hurdles, striving for quality content, and keeping up with administrative processes.

        <rp.h2>Overcoming Communication Hurdles</rp.h2>
        <rp.p>
          Effective communication is the cornerstone of successful collaboration, yet it can become a significant challenge when working with freelance content creators.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          For one, most creators have full-time jobs and do content creation on the side, which means they can’t always reply to messages as soon as they should.
          Having to juggle between work and content creation also means that creators often fall into the habit of missing out on submission deadlines.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          As a result, businesses must go the extra mile to make sure that creators are submitting and uploading their videos on time.
          Having to constantly check-in with the creators can be time-consuming, and having to do so whilst running a business is simply exhausting.
        </rp.p>

        <rp.h2>Maintaining Quality Content</rp.h2>
        <rp.p>
          While we appreciate content creators for their individual creativity and personal styles, it can be quite challenging having to align these differences with the brand’s vision and identity.
          The varying level of expertise that creators bring to the table is also an element that could greatly affect the quality of the content produced.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          As such, it is important that businesses identify the type of content they want for their campaigns.
          Preparing clear and thorough campaign briefs can help guide the content-making process and remove the possibility of receiving low quality videos.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          But even then, poor videos are simply inevitable.
          You are bound to receive little nuggets of them here and there.
        </rp.p>

        <rp.h2>Keeping Up with Administrative Processes</rp.h2>
        <rp.p>
          It’s true, completing administrative tasks such as filing invoices, drafting agreements, and scheduling content are not as exciting as its creative counterparts.
          Not to mention that it can be very time-consuming too.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          It is no wonder then that many businesses are turned away from working with content creators.
          Shouldering this supplementary work buys into the precious time that could be spent on other pressing aspects of the business.
        </rp.p>
        <rp.p>
          If only there were a way to overcome all of this …
